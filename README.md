Node.js: creating my first library

These were my first steps in learning node.js to import and use code from open source repositories;
I understood what promises are and how to work with asynchronous code in Node.js;
I wrote regular expressions and saw how to use them to solve problems;
I created my own commands to run in the terminal. In addition to using the latest Node.js libraries to make HTTP requests and handle responses.
